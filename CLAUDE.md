# Claude Context

This is a **TypeScript learning project**. Explanations and teaching are welcome.

## Conventions

- Package scope is `@learning` — new packages should use `@learning/<name>`
- Prefer local tooling (`npx tsc`) over global installs
- Keep examples simple and focused — don't over-engineer
- Use npm workspaces commands: `npm run <script> -w @learning/<package>`

## Project Structure

- `packages/projects/` — Mini projects (e.g., movies)
- `packages/concepts/` — TypeScript concept explorations
